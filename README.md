# AddZoomMetadata
An example of how to add metadata to Zoom recordings.

        // Penn State has defined a custom metadata field which allows end users
        // to flag how their media is used:  course content, personal, etc.  We
        // have also added a "Zoom Recording" selection, which isn't really a "usage",
        // but more of a source.  We did this to make it easy to find their zoom
        // recordings using the MediaSpace search filter.
        //
